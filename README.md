### Weather App

This program was built using the OpenWeatherMap.org API along with the MVC design pattern 
and Gson library provided via Maven.

This app was created as a practical way of learning how to interface and interact with an api. 
Upon launching this app you will be met with a simple gui that asks you for your location.
You can enter a city name or cycle through the other valid input options using the provided arrow keys.

Once a valid location is entered then a new window will open containing the city name weather
description and temperature in fahrenheit. If you wish to search the temperature of another city you 
can simply hit the search icon in the top left corner.
